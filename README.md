# Tableau-Citi-Bike-Data-Analysis-Dashboard
This project was undertaken as part of the Data Analytics Boot Camp at the University of Toronto. It involved the creation of visualizations, dashboards, and a narrative using Tableau, focusing on the New York Citi Bike Program, the largest bike-sharing initiative in the United States.

Since its inception in 2013, the program has developed a comprehensive data collection system, regularly publishing bike utilization data on the Citi Bike Data webpage. The Tableau dashboard was designed to streamline reporting processes, offering a collection of visualizations tailored to provide insightful data reports for city officials.

## Data Used
For the Data Analysis I have used the data of full 2022, because Tableau Public has limitations so I picked only the data for 1 year. 

## Dashboard Link
Following is the link on Tableau Public to access the visualizations:
